    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      As a technically proficient software engineer and certified Salesforce
      developer, I bring a solid foundation in data analytics, technical
      support, system integration, and Salesforce development expertise. After
      several years of successfully helping build scalable solutions in both the
      blockchain and fintech sectors, I've chosen to broaden my impact by
      pursuing a Master of Science in Business Development and Management. This
      academic advancement reflects my strategic pivot toward roles that merge
      technical insight with business acumen. I am now focused on leveraging my
      engineering background to drive innovation, process improvement, and
      strategic growth within cross-functional teams and business- facing
      environments.
